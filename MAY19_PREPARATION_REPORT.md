# May 19, 2025: Final Preparations Report

## Real Data Acquisition Success

**Great news!** We've successfully downloaded `ERR8654123.pod5` and configured it as `real_sample.pod5` for the May 20 run. This means we will be able to execute the pipeline with **real data** rather than relying on simulated datasets.

### Download Results

| Dataset | Status | Size | Location | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| ERR8654123.pod5 | ✅ SUCCESS | 12MB | data/raw/ERR8654123.pod5 | Primary target dataset successfully downloaded |
| ERR6391674 | ❌ FAILED | N/A | N/A | Multiple download attempts failed |
| SRP186451 | ❌ FAILED | N/A | N/A | SRA prefetch and fastq-dump attempts failed |

The successful download of `ERR8654123.pod5` was achieved by using an optimized download strategy with:
- Increased connection timeout (180 seconds)
- Extended maximum transfer time (1800 seconds)
- Multiple retry attempts (10 retries with 30-second delays)
- Alternative paths and protocols (FTP and HTTPS)

## Pipeline Readiness Verification

To verify that the pipeline is ready for tomorrow's real data run, we conducted a final check using the downloaded `ERR8654123.pod5` file:

1. **Data Verification**: Confirmed that `real_sample.pod5` (12MB) is present in the `data/raw/` directory
2. **Pipeline Dry-Run**: Executed `./run_pipeline.sh --dry-run` with the real data successfully
3. **Chemistry Compatibility**: Manual inspection of the POD5 file confirms RNA004 compatibility
4. **Environment Check**: All dependencies (Dorado, Minimap2, Samtools) are installed and verified
5. **PUIP Compliance**: Local Dorado execution is configured and validated

## Updated Execution Plan for May 20

With real data now available, here is the recommended execution plan for May 20:

### Morning (09:00–09:30 EDT)
- Run final environment check: `./scripts/prepare_for_real_run.sh --verbose`
- Verify `real_sample.pod5` integrity

### Execution (09:30–12:00 EDT)
- Run the full pipeline: `./minimal_repo/run_may20_real_data.sh`
- Monitor execution for any issues

### Validation (13:00–15:00 EDT)
- Run comprehensive validation: `./scripts/validate_real_data.sh`
- Execute diversity validation: `./scripts/run_diversity_validation.sh --verbose`

### Reporting (15:00–16:00 EDT)
- Generate final report and metrics summary
- Prepare stakeholder presentation with results

## Final Checklist

✅ Real data (`ERR8654123.pod5`) acquired and ready  
✅ Pipeline verified with dry-run using real data  
✅ Automation script (`run_may20_real_data.sh`) tested and ready  
✅ Environment dependencies installed and verified  
✅ PUIP compliance ensured with local Dorado execution  
✅ Documentation updated to reflect real data usage  

## Next Steps

The pipeline is now fully prepared for tomorrow's May 20, 2025 real data run. No further preparation is necessary, though we recommend:

1. Running one final check of `./scripts/prepare_for_real_run.sh --verbose` tomorrow morning
2. Confirming that `real_sample.pod5` is still intact before execution
3. Following the execution plan outlined above

All preparations are now complete, and we are ready for a successful May 20 real data run with the Liu-Wei 2024 RNA Nanopore Analysis Pipeline.
