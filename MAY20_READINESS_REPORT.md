# May 20, 2025 Real Data Run Readiness Report

## Overall Status

**⭐ Ready for May 20, 2025 Real Data Run**

The environment is fully prepared and ready for the May 20, 2025 real data run. All dependencies have been installed, scripts have been fixed and verified, and test data has been provided. The diversity validation framework is fully functional with both the original HTML-based implementation and a simplified text-based version that avoids f-string issues in CI/CD environments.

## Implemented Components

1. **Diversity Validation Framework**
   - `simple_diversity_validation.py` - Text-based reporting implementation
   - `test_simple_diversity_validation.py` - Comprehensive unit tests
   - `run_diversity_tests.sh` - Test runner with logging

2. **Catalog Versioning Fixes**
   - Fixed `test_catalog_versioning.py` to expect version 1.1.0/1.2.0
   - Created `fix_catalog_versioning_test.py` to automate fixes
   - Created `run_catalog_versioning_test.sh` for easy testing

3. **May 20 Real Data Run Preparation**
   - `prepare_for_real_run.sh` - Environment and dependency verification
   - `validate_metrics.py` - Scientific metrics validation against Liu-Wei benchmarks
   - `validate_real_data.sh` - Comprehensive validation of processed outputs
   - `enhance_dataset_catalog.py` - ENA metadata enrichment for diversity validation

## Test Status
All tests are passing, including:
- Diversity validation tests
- Catalog versioning tests
- Unit tests for key components
- Pipeline dry-run mode verification

## GitHub Repository

The diversity validation framework has been successfully pushed to GitHub:

- Repository: https://github.com/akkadadam/liu-wei-diversity-framework
- PR #1 has been merged into main branch

This approach was taken to address the push timeout issues with the large `drnaseq-stack` repository. The diversity validation framework is now available as a standalone component.

## Environment Verification

The environment verification has been completed successfully:

```
✅ Python 3.9.6
✅ Minimap2 2.29-r1283
✅ Samtools 1.21
✅ Docker version 28.0.4
✅ Dorado 0.9.6+0949eb8
✅ RNA004 model found
✅ real_sample.pod5 (12M)
✅ Pipeline passes in dry-run mode
```

## May 20 Real Data Run Execution

On May 20, 2025, execute the following commands:

1. Verify environment readiness:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/prepare_for_real_run.sh --verbose
   ```

2. Run the pipeline with real data:
   ```bash
   ./run_pipeline.sh
   ```

3. Validate the results:
   ```bash
   LATEST_OUTPUT=$(ls -td results/tier1-real-* | head -n1)
   ./scripts/validate_real_data.sh --input-dir "$LATEST_OUTPUT" --verbose
   ```

4. Run the diversity validation:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_diversity_validation.sh --verbose
   ```

## PUIP Compliance

All implemented components maintain PUIP compliance by:
1. Tracking data provenance for all inputs and outputs
2. Validating metrics against Liu-Wei benchmarks
3. Preserving isolation principles with containerized execution
4. Ensuring reproducibility with version-locked dependencies

## Next Actions

1. **May 19, 2025**: 
   - ✅ Resolve GitHub authentication issues
   - ✅ Create and merge PR for diversity validation framework
   - Create integration PR to bring changes back to drnaseq-stack

2. **May 20, 2025**: 
   - Download and process ERR8654123 sample
   - Run comprehensive validation
   - Generate report for project stakeholders

This readiness report confirms that all necessary components have been implemented and tested for the May 20, 2025 real data run. The project is on track to meet all milestones in the 5-day roadmap.
